Strategize effectively due to disconnected or raw data formats

This dashboard addresses those gaps by centralizing all key performance metrics in one place.

Which regions offer the most family-friendly or expert-level skiing?
Where is summer skiing available?
What countries have the most well-equipped resorts?
‚Ä¶ are difficult to answer quickly with raw data.
